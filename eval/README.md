# Evaluation

this document describes the approach that will be used to experiment with
and evaluate the technique we are developing. It will also discuss the
artifacts that are going to be used to this end.

## Approach



## Artifacts

We consider a variety of control system artifacts which lend themselves to
techniques that rely on symbolic execution. These artifacts are primarily
from the [SIR](http://sir.unl.edu/portal/index.php) repository which also
provides variants/mutations for most of its programs.

### Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)



### Wheel Brake System (WBS)



### Elevator control system
