# Requirements

The following are the requirements for the final project writeup:

You should submit a writeup describing your work on the project.   Include
an appropriate background, what you have
accomplished, and a section on the potential for future work.   It is this
last component that I think is most interesting.   You should try to
identify whether, with additional work, you think you could improve on the
state-of-the-art relative to your project topic.   If the answer is
positive, then an assessment of the additional work would be valuable.
